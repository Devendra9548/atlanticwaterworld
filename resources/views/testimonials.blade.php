                    <p>A good place to visit. Before visiting we had doubts about water quality,
                        crowd, gentry, food, toilets etc. etc. But we were pleasantly surprised that
                        things were very smooth. Water was clean and all places were spick and
                        span.

                    <p>It was a wonderful visit to the Atlantic water world. They have so many items where we can play.
                        May look adventurous, but , they maintain high safety standards. Definitely you can try out all
                        of them, at reasonable cost</p>
